To set up the ImageNet-1k dataset, the accompanying makefile relies on the [Kaggle API](https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-api). After successfully installing the API, run the following commands:

```
make imagenet
make imagenet100
```

The ImageNet-100 dataset is a subset of ImageNet-1k. For more detailed information, please consult the [Contrastive Multiview Coding paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.05849).
